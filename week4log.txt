Week 4 Log – Preliminary Results

This week focused on completing full training cycles for all selected models, analyzing early quantitative results, and identifying trends that will guide deeper tuning in the next phase.

1. Full Training Execution
- Trained all four architectures (ResNet, ConvNeXt, EfficientNet-B0, MobileNet) for the full planned number of epochs.
- Applied the finalized data augmentation pipeline, including random cropping, flips and color perturbations.
- Tuned base hyperparameters to ensure stable optimization across models.
- Generated checkpoints and validation logs at each epoch for later comparison.

2. Baseline Evaluation
- Collected initial accuracy, loss curves, and epoch-wise validation performance for each architecture.
- Observed steady convergence in all models, with EfficientNet-B0 and ConvNeXt showing comparatively faster early improvements.
- Measured training time per epoch to quantify computational differences across architectures.
- Verified that all models reached competitive baseline accuracy levels suitable for further refinement.

3. Preliminary Findings
- Modern architectures (ConvNeXt and EfficientNet-B0) demonstrated stronger early generalization on the pet dataset.
- MobileNet remained the most computationally efficient, confirming its advantage in lightweight scenarios.
- Identified mild overfitting tendencies in later epochs for some models, suggesting the need for additional regularization.
- Detected consistent misclassification patterns in specific classes, indicating potential class imbalance or challenging visual categories.
