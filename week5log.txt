Week 5 Log – Final Training & Performance Analysis

This week focused on completing the full set of experimental evaluations, analyzing the collected results, and preparing the final deliverables required for project submission.

1. Final Training Runs
- Executed complete and finalized training schedules for all four architectures (ResNet, ConvNeXt, EfficientNet-B0, MobileNet).
- Ensured consistent training configurations across models to enable fair comparison.
- Integrated refined augmentation and regularization settings based on Week 4 findings.
- Saved the final model checkpoints and associated training metadata for documentation and reproducibility.

2. Performance Metrics Collection
- Compiled the full set of evaluation metrics including top 1 accuracy, loss values, per class performance and confusion matrices.
- Measured computational characteristics such as training time per epoch, total training time and inference latency.
- Collected metrics across multiple runs to reduce variance and ensure reliability of results.
- Exported all performance logs, plots and numerical summaries for inclusion in the final report.

3. Comparative Analysis
- Conducted a detailed comparison of all four models based on accuracy, efficiency and generalization behavior.
- Identified that ConvNeXt and EfficientNet-B0 delivered the strongest overall performance while MobileNet remained the most lightweight option.
- Analyzed misclassification trends and class wise error distributions to understand model weaknesses.
- Summarized strengths and limitations of each architecture to support final conclusions.

4. Final Deliverables & Video Recording
- Recorded and finalized the video as required for the project submission.
- Ensured all materials—code, logs, plots, analysis and documentation—were consolidated and ready for submission.
- Completed final checks on reproducibility.
