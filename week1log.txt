Project: SOTA Models Comparison (Large Networks)

Dataset:
We are using a custom 37-category pet dataset with roughly 200 images per class. 
The images contain large variations in scale, pose, and lighting conditions. 
Each image is accompanied by detailed ground-truth annotations including:
- Breed label
- Head region-of-interest (ROI)
- Pixel-level trimap segmentation

This dataset supports both classification and segmentation tasks.

Models Used:
For this project, we are comparing several state-of-the-art convolutional neural network architectures:

1. ResNet
2. ConvNeXt
3. EfficientNet-B0
4. MobileNet

These models are trained and evaluated on the same dataset to analyze performance differences across architectures.
